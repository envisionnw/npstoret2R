## Overview

The whole purpose of npstoret2R is to enable you to import NPSTORET results and standards, then begin water quality analysis.

This vignette is simply to give you a sense of how to best prepare for running npstoret2R.


## Preparing a Run.R script

The following example shows how to prepare a run.R script for pulling in 
your NPSTORET data for analysis.

Remember that this script will enable you to pull in data from the NPSTORET
database of your choice, but if you want to save the results of your
analysis, you'll want to save your Environment and its *.RData file for later use.

```
\dontrun{
# ------------------------------------
# Running npstoret2R
# ------------------------------------
#
# ----------------------
# Initialize Environment & Connect to Db
# ----------------------
# environment for variables to avoid collisions with .GlobalEnv
 pkgEnv <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())
 initializeEnvironment()

# ----------------------
# Connect to Db
# ----------------------
# note app must be in both assignment as argument of dbfilepathname otherwise it doesn't work

 app <- dbfilepathname(app, "C:/NPSTORET_DATA/NPSTORET_BE.MDB") 

 app$connect <- odbcConnectAccess2007(app[["dbfilepathname"]])

 assign("npstoret",app,envir=pkgEnv) 

# ----------------------
# Import NPSTORET results & standards
# ----------------------
 initializeData()
}
```
