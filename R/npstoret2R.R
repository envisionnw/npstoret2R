#' \bold{ CONNECT, IMPORT, & ANALYZE }
#' 
#' It's best if you're working from a local copy of your
#' NPSTORET database. You'll first connect to the database
#' then pull in your sample data using either \code{\link{loadNPSTORETData}} or
#' \code{\link{loadNPSTORETWQData}} which enables you to
#' import sampling results, characteristics (WQ standards),
#' and other NPSTORET data. Sampling 'results' include
#' attributes that enable npstoret2R to compare
#' sample values to appropriate water quality standards.
#' 
#' \bold{ WATER QUALITY STANDARDS }
#' 
#' Water quality standards depend on the park, project,
#' and sample type. They vary by locale and the
#' ecological/legal agreements for the various samples
#' and measurements collected. 
#' 
#' \bold{ INDEPENDENT STANDARDS }
#' 
#' Some characteristics have set standard values which
#' do not vary. These 'independent' standards are contained
#' within NPSTORET.
#' 
#' \bold{ DEPENDENT STANDARDS }
#' 
#' Other characteristics depend on other factors. These 'dependent'
#' water quality standards depend not only on the location (park, project), 
#' but also on other water quality sample values obtained on the same visit.
#' These related characteristics include pH, hardness (Ca+Mg), temperature, and time.
#' So for some samples (ex: Cu, Cd, Mn), the standard must be
#' calculated based on the values of these dependent characteristics.
#' 
#' npstoret2R calculates dependent standards based on the values for 
#' those dependencies for the visit and the formulas and coefficients 
#' identified within NPSTORET.**
#' 
#' \bold{ COMPLIANCE COMPARISON }
#' 
#' With both dependent (calculated) standards and 'independent' 
#' water quality standards, npstoret2R compares these to 
#' sampling results to identify which results are not compliant.
#' 
#' Compliance is reported as +1, 0, or -1 based on whether the 
#' result is above, at, or below the water quality standard (either
#' calculated/dependent or independent).
#' 
#' \bold{ A TOOL, NOT A REPLACEMENT }
#' 
#' Of course, npstoret2R is only a tool. 
#' 
#' It does not replace the intelligence or expertise of the ecologist, 
#' limnologist, or water quality specialist assessing water 
#' quality compliance to standards. 
#' 
#' Clearly the values it provides should be reviewed and assessed 
#' for accuracy. This is particilarly true for early versions of the 
#' tool. There is no substitute for the clear thinking of the 
#' well-trained scientific mind. No program, however excellent it may 
#' be, can substitute for good judgement and thoughtful, thorough analysis.
#' 
#'  NOTE:
#'    ** Standards that are time dependent are currently omitted from 
#'    calculation.
