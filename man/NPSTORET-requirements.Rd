\title{NPSTORET DATABASE REQUIREMENTS}
\description{
When connecting an NPSTORET local database to npstoret2R, the following tables MUST be present.
If they are missing, npstoret2R will be unable to run the queries necessary to connect results
with characteristic water quality standards.

\bold{\emph{REQUIRED NPSTORET TABLES}}
\itemize{
 \item tblActivities
 \item tblAnalyticalProcedures
 \item tblCharacteristics
 \item tblFieldProcedures
 \item tblLocations
 \item tblLocationProjectAssignment
 \item tblLocationStationGroups
 \item tblLocationStationGroupAssignment
 \item tblLocationWQStandardAssignment
 \item tblOrganizations
 \item tblProjects
 \item tblResults
 \item tblVisits
 \item tblWQStandardCriteria
 \item tblDef_ActivityTypes
 \item tblDef_TSRUOM
 \item qryTaxon *
 \item tblDef_BIOPT *
}
* Required only for \code{\link{loadNPSTORETData}} ( \code{\link{loadNPSTORETWQData}} does not use these tables).

Because of the sometimes large data sets, it is highly recommended that a local copy of your
NPSTORET Access database be used.

\bold{\emph{IMPORTING FROM NETWORK DATABASES}}

Importing from network databases has not been tested and
is likely to fail without a fast network connection and sufficient computer memory.
If you have been successful connecting to a network database, please email the author (\email{Bonnie_Campbell@nps.gov})
with specifics so this success can be documented.
