\description{
The following example shows how to prepare a run.R script for pulling in
your NPSTORET data for analysis.\cr
\cr
Remember that this script will enable you to pull in data from the NPSTORET
database of your choice, but if you want to save the results of your
analysis, you'll want to save your Environment and its *.RData file for later use.\cr

Initialize Environment & Connect to Db\cr
----------------------\cr
environment for variables to avoid collisions with .GlobalEnv\cr
\code{ pkgEnv <- new.env(parent = emptyenv()) }
}
\details{
\code{ initializeEnvironment() }
\cr
----------------------\cr
Connect to Db\cr
----------------------\cr
note app must be in both assignment as argument of dbfilepathname otherwise it doesn't work\cr \cr
\code{ app <- dbfilepathname(app, "C:/NPSTORET_DATA/NPSTORET_BE.MDB") }
\cr
\code{ app$connect <- odbcConnectAccess2007(app[["dbfilepathname"]]) }

\code{ assign("npstoret",app,envir=pkgEnv) }
\cr \cr
create data frames\cr
\code{ initializeData() }
